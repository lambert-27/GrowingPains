* Provide error handling (e.g., ensure users cannot enter a 'string' into a field expecting an 'int', properly structured email addresses, etc.)
* Display core OOSD principles (inheritance, aggregation, composition)
* Utilize technical documentation from the previous semester's Systems Analysis and Design project

## Technologies Used

* Java
